## Growth Hacking with NLP and Sentiment Analysis

The project attempts to simulate a common workflow where groups (data scientists) use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover insights using textual data. 
The hypothetical task in this case is working within a gaming analytics start-up to gather incurring growth (growth hacking) through customer acquisition with the lowest cost i.e. modelling solutions to optimise for specific consumer preferences based on evaluating our competitors' products.
Hence, the challenge is to create a sentiment analyser that'll give a deeper understanding of customer feedback and opinions.
